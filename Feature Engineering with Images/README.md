# Feature Engineering with Images

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the application of feature engineering techniques on image data. Feature engineering involves transforming raw image data into meaningful features that enhance the performance of machine learning models. By effectively processing and engineering features from images, the model's accuracy and robustness can be significantly improved.

## Key Features

- **Image Data Transformation:** Applies various feature engineering techniques to transform raw image data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts meaningful features from image data using techniques such as edge detection, color histograms, and texture analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performs EDA to understand the image data patterns and relationships.
