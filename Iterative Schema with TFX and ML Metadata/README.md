# Iterative Schema with TFX and ML Metadata

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow Extended (TFX) and ML Metadata for iterative schema development. TFX is an end-to-end platform for deploying production machine learning pipelines, and ML Metadata is a library for recording and retrieving metadata associated with machine learning workflows. Iterative schema development helps ensure data quality and consistency throughout the machine learning pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Iterative Schema Development:** Utilizes TFX and ML Metadata to iteratively develop and refine data schemas.
- **Data Quality Assurance:** Ensures data quality and consistency through schema validation and anomaly detection.
- **Metadata Management:** Records and retrieves metadata associated with the machine learning pipeline.
- **Automation:** Automates the process of schema generation and validation as part of the ML pipeline.

## Files

- `Iterative_Schema_with_TFX_and_ML_Metadata.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for iterative schema development using TFX and ML Metadata.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the raw dataset for schema development.
2. **Initial Schema Generation:** Generated an initial schema based on the dataset.
3. **Schema Validation:** Validated the dataset against the generated schema to identify anomalies.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Detected and analyzed anomalies in the dataset.
5. **Schema Refinement:** Refined the schema iteratively based on anomaly detection results.
6. **Metadata Management:** Recorded and retrieved metadata associated with the iterative schema development process.
7. **Automation:** Automated schema generation and validation as part of the TFX pipeline.
8. **Results:** Analyzed and documented the impact of iterative schema development on data quality and consistency.

## Conclusion

By using TFX and ML Metadata, I was able to iteratively develop and refine data schemas, ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the machine learning pipeline. This project highlights the importance of schema development and metadata management in building robust and reliable ML pipelines.
