# Distributed Training with TF and Keras

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of distributed training using TensorFlow and Keras. Distributed training helps to scale machine learning models by leveraging multiple GPUs or TPUs, thereby reducing the training time and improving model performance.

## Key Features

- **Distributed Strategy:** Utilizes TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.Strategy` to distribute training across multiple devices.
- **Scalability:** Demonstrates how to scale model training using multiple GPUs or TPUs.
- **Performance Optimization:** Aims to improve the training efficiency and model performance through distributed training.

## Files

- `Distributed_training_with_TF_and_Keras.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for distributed training using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Preparation:** Loaded and preprocessed the dataset to make it suitable for distributed training.
2. **Model Definition:** Defined a Keras model to be trained in a distributed manner.
3. **Distributed Strategy:** Applied TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.Strategy` to enable distributed training.
4. **Training:** Trained the model using multiple devices to demonstrate the scalability and performance benefits.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model performance and training efficiency with the distributed setup.
6. **Results:** Analyzed and documented the results obtained from the distributed training process.

## Conclusion

By implementing distributed training with TensorFlow and Keras, I was able to scale the model training process, thereby improving training efficiency and model performance. This project showcases the benefits of distributed training for large-scale machine learning models.
