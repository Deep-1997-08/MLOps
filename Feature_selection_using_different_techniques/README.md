# Feature Selection Using Different Techniques

## Project Description

This project demonstrates various techniques for feature selection in machine learning. Feature selection is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves selecting the most relevant features for model training. By reducing the number of features, feature selection helps improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and decrease computational cost.

## Key Features

- **Filter Methods:** Utilizes statistical techniques to select features based on their relationship with the target variable.
- **Wrapper Methods:** Employs machine learning models to evaluate the importance of features.
- **Embedded Methods:** Integrates feature selection as part of the model training process.
- **Comparison:** Compares the performance of different feature selection techniques.
