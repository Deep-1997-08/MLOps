# TFDV (TensorFlow Data Validation)

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) for data validation and analysis. TFDV is a library used for exploring and validating machine learning data at scale. It helps in understanding data distributions, detecting anomalies, and ensuring data quality before training machine learning models.

## Key Features

- **Data Validation:** Utilizes TFDV to validate data, ensuring it meets quality and consistency standards.
- **Data Exploration:** Explores data distributions and statistics to understand the dataset better.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detects anomalies in the data that could impact model performance.
- **Schema Generation:** Generates schemas that define the expected structure and properties of the data.

## Files

- `TFDV.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data validation and analysis using TFDV.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the raw dataset for validation and analysis.
2. **Data Statistics:** Computed and visualized statistics of the dataset using TFDV.
3. **Schema Generation:** Generated a schema to define the expected structure and properties of the data.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Detected anomalies in the dataset that could affect model training.
5. **Data Validation:** Validated the dataset against the generated schema to ensure data quality.
6. **Results:** Analyzed and documented the findings from the data validation process.

## Conclusion

By using TensorFlow Data Validation, I was able to explore and validate the dataset, ensuring it meets the necessary quality and consistency standards. This project highlights the importance of data validation in the machine learning pipeline to prevent potential issues and improve model performance.
