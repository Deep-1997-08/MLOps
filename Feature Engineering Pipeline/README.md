# Feature Engineering Pipeline

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the creation of a feature engineering pipeline. A feature engineering pipeline systematically transforms raw data into meaningful features, enhancing the performance of machine learning models. By automating the feature engineering process, the pipeline ensures consistency and efficiency in preparing data for modeling.

## Key Features

- **Automated Pipeline:** Implements an automated feature engineering pipeline for consistent data transformation.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes steps for data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier treatment.
- **Feature Creation:** Generates new features using domain knowledge and various engineering techniques.
- **Data Transformation:** Applies transformations such as scaling, encoding, and normalization.
- **Modular Design:** Designed to be easily extended or modified for different datasets and tasks.

## Files

- `Feature_Engineering_Pipeline.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for the feature engineering pipeline.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the raw dataset for analysis and preprocessing.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
3. **Feature Creation:** Created new features based on domain knowledge and specific requirements of the task.
4. **Data Transformation:** Applied transformations such as scaling, encoding, and normalization to prepare the data for modeling.
5. **Pipeline Construction:** Built a modular and automated pipeline to streamline the feature engineering process.
6. **Modeling:** Used the engineered features to train and evaluate a machine learning model.
7. **Results:** Analyzed and documented the impact of the feature engineering pipeline on model performance.

## Conclusion

By developing a feature engineering pipeline, I was able to automate and standardize the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features. This project underscores the importance of a systematic approach to feature engineering in improving the efficiency and performance of machine learning models.
