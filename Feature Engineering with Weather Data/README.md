# Feature Engineering with Weather Data

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the application of feature engineering techniques on weather data. Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create features that make machine learning algorithms work better. By transforming raw weather data into meaningful features, the model's performance and predictive power can be significantly enhanced.

## Key Features

- **Data Transformation:** Applies various feature engineering techniques to transform raw weather data.
- **Feature Creation:** Creates new features based on domain knowledge to improve model performance.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performs EDA to understand the data distribution and relationships.

## Files

- `Feature_Engineering_with_Weather_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for feature engineering with weather data.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the raw weather dataset for analysis and preprocessing.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
3. **Feature Creation:** Generated new features based on domain knowledge of weather patterns.
4. **Data Transformation:** Applied transformations such as scaling, encoding, and normalization to prepare the data for modeling.
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted EDA to visualize and understand the relationships between features.
6. **Modeling:** Used the engineered features to train and evaluate a machine learning model.
7. **Results:** Analyzed and documented the impact of feature engineering on model performance.

## Conclusion

By applying feature engineering techniques to weather data, I was able to transform raw data into meaningful features, thereby improving the model's predictive performance. This project highlights the importance of feature engineering in the machine learning pipeline.
